Helped build the first initial Alpha/MVP before being hired on as part of the initial engineering team.

Being a startup/small team means that everyone had a hand in almost everything, but I initially took ownership of the content management system and any backend services to support it. I worked on multiple microservices to help support the mobile and web applications as well. These ranged in scope and language/framework. My personal favorite was a hate and suicidal ideation speech detection model/API which would automatically flag messages for manual review. It was my first real dive into LSTMs/RNNs and even though the content was dark the project was interesting.

Spent a fair amount of time helping my coworker with the Android applications as well (for both Churchome & Faithful). Applications were a mix of Java and Kotlin.

Most of the front end applications were either Vue or React, with the microservices being a mix of Python (Flask) and Node (Express). MongoDB made the most sense given our data structures and use cases.
