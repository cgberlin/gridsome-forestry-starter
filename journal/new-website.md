Very much still a work in progress.

There is a seemingly endless flood of 'code-less' and flat-file style CMS platforms coming out. At this point I feel pretty confident in saying I must have tried them all (impossible, but maybe 90%). I am planning to just do an actual write up with links to the repo on how this was all setup as I am pretty happy with the final result. [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry"), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/ "Vue"), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify").
