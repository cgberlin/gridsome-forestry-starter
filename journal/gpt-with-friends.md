"Logs posted here for inner laughs"

**Bryce told Aaron** "Be a good boy and go get me a bottle of wine from the cellar."

Maddox flipped on the light and pulled the bottle from the bottom shelf.

"You're going to need a large one, love. More than a gallon."

He slapped her butt lightly and pushed her away from him.

"I'll go get it while you get that champagne on ice."

She bounded up the stairs. 

It was funny how she liked to tease him but didn't want him to feel left out.

When she came back down, she handed him a glass.

"There's just one problem," he said as he took the glass from her.

"What's that?"

"There's no glass straw to fit this wine bottle."

Bryce shot him a cocky grin and grinned back.

"You're not getting through that thing."

Bryce snorted.

"You forget, I'm half demon. I can work with whatever I have to."

He took a long swallow of the wine.

"I see your girlfriend got you started drinking the hard stuff."

Maddox laughed. 

"Come on, Bryce. When was the last time you had a glass of champagne?"

"When was the last time you ate something healthy?"

"Hell no. I only have low blood sugar. I need carbs to make it last through my shift."

"I think you're missing out on a whole lot of life, but we'll discuss that another day.

 There's a problem. 

I need to go to the wine cellar to get a corkscrew. And a straw."

"You're right. That's gonna be a problem."

"Why?" 

He took another sip of the wine and grimaced.

"Because every single female employee has been sent to stock the kitchen. Including you. So I'm pretty much on my own. I'll go to the kitchen and see what I can find."

Maddox watched as Bryce stalked away.

"I'll go to the cellar and get us both something to eat."

He poured the rest of the bottle into two glasses and carried them to the couch.

Maddox took a sip of the wine and grimaced.

"Do you know what they put in this shit to make it taste so good?"

"Not really."

"And it is really strong stuff."

He held up his glass and studied it.

"It's thick. I don't know if I can handle a whole glass."

Maddox nodded. 

"I'm gonna need something to settle my stomach first."

He drank the rest of the glass in one big gulp and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

"Shit."

"What is it?"

Bryce popped his head into the living room.

"Is there something you need, Mr. Romanov?"

Maddox shook his head. "No, my stomach isn't acting up."

He grimaced. 

"Just a little dry mouth."

"That's to be expected, sir. It is a fine vintage."

Maddox grimaced and took another sip of the wine. 

The crisp, sweet taste filled his mouth and he slowly smiled.

"Yeah. I guess that works."

"Not a problem. I'll bring you some more in a moment."

Bryce disappeared from the room. 

Maddox looked at his half brother.

"What can I do for you, Bryce?"

Bryce shook his head and made a 'hmm' sound.

"I don't know if you can help, but I've never seen it done this way. I tried to punch through the back of the bottle with my fist and couldn't do it. You should try it."

Maddox frowned. 

"What?"

"Punch through the back of the bottle,"

Bryce repeated. 

"You need to be standing up and facing the wall when you do it. It'll look odd otherwise. Go ahead."

Maddox looked at his half brother in confusion. 

"But why?"

"How else are you going to get that back into the bottle?" 

Bryce smiled.

"Think about it this way. If you aren't standing up, the fact that the bottle's right side up means it's empty. If you're standing up, it means it's not. The spout's right there in the middle, so you can put the handle against the wall and open it just enough to lean into the bottle and punch it back in."

Maddox gulped at the thought. 

"Are you serious?"

Bryce nodded.

"When you punch the bottle, you want to get a good solid connection. Not a short punch. A long, strong one. It needs to be like a kicking motion."

He held up his hand. 

"I'm just gonna demonstrate this."

Maddox eyed him warily.

"Just don't knock the damn thing over."

Bryce tapped a fist into the palm of his other hand.

"Oh, no worries. I won't. The trick is to open your hand while you're doing it and squeeze the bottle a little to make a seal so it doesn't fall out of your hand."

Maddox watched in amazement as Bryce opened his hand and pounded the back of the bottle twice. 

The cork popped out and he sloshed the contents onto the couch, then repeated the motion.

"Does it work every time?"

"As long as you do it right?"

"Absolutely." 

Bryce winked. 

"You're gonna be a natural, kiddo."

"What if I get dizzy or throw up or something?"

Bryce clucked his tongue. 

"If it doesn't work, don't worry. It'll get easier. And if you have to get down on your hands and knees, so be it. Punching a wall isn't a pleasant thing."

Maddox frowned and followed him into the kitchen, clutching the bottle.

"I don't know about this, Bryce. I don't want to go down on my hands and knees."

"You don't have to. I'll come in after a minute or two to watch."

"Don't go in there." 

Maddox looked at his half brother, his eyes wide.

"I'll come in after a minute or two."

"No!" Bryce raised his hands and smiled.

"You're doing great. I'll wait outside."

Maddox nodded and gritted his teeth, then turned to the wall and put his fist against it. 

His hand burned with pain, but he forced it forward and flexed his muscles, feeling the biceps flex, straining the skin.

He gritted his teeth harder and grabbed the bottle, swinging it back and forth a few times.

Then he went for the first time, pausing as the pain took hold. 

He was standing, staring at the wall, when Bryce appeared at the doorway and whistled.

"Damn, my boy!"

Maddox was gasping.

"How did you do that?"

"You're making your hand stronger. You did it!" 

Bryce grinned.

"If you can do it once, you can do it again."

Maddox stared at the bottle and frowned. 

Then he punched the wall three times and pumped his fist in the air.

"Yeah! I did it!"

"I'll let you get a shower. I'll take care of the cat."

"Yeah. Okay."
